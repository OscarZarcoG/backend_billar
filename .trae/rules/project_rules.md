# Project Rules

1. Never run servers on your local machine (npm start, node index.js, python manage.py runserver, expo start, npm run dev)

2. Always use the official documentation of each technology.
When implementing or configuring libraries, frameworks, or dependencies, refer only to official documentation. (I have already placed some links to official documentation inside you.)

3. Do not create test, debug, or experimental files.

4. Follow the project’s naming and structural conventions.
Maintain consistent folder structures, file names, and component organization to ensure readability and maintainability.

5. Prioritize code clarity and maintainability over speed of delivery.
Favor clean, well-documented, and scalable solutions over quick or improvised ones.

6. Do not install unnecessary or redundant dependencies.
Each dependency must have a clear and documented purpose. Reuse existing or native alternatives whenever possible.

7. Validate and test code before committing or deploying.
Ensure that all changes pass at least a basic functional check or review before being pushed to the main repository.

8. Use reusable and modular components.
Build components that can be reused across different parts of the system to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

9. Ensure all interfaces are responsive.
The design must properly adapt to various screen sizes and devices.

10. Handle errors gracefully.
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to ensure the system can recover from unexpected situations without crashing.

11. Prioritize accessibility.

12. Prioritize clarity and maintainability over speed.
Favor clean, readable, and scalable solutions over quick fixes.

13. Do not mix responsibilities in components or functions.
Follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

14. Never use emojis in code.
